## SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENTS
1. Tokenization on all string based features like amenities , summary , description etc to find keywords which affects the pricing and provide a rating to those keywords . Based on the rating we can create new feature with summation of ratings and studying the correlation with price.

2. Detect more outliers based on price , as currently happeining in case of accomadation and bathrooms

3. Like distance_from_central , we can detect distance from Airport to find any correlation with price.

4. Creating clusters based on lat/long and and validate if it effects the price , as some areas must have high property rates , thus renting more.
